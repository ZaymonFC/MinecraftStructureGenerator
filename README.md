# Minecraft Structure Generator
Inspired by [this excellent post](http://www.timphilipwilliams.com/posts/2019-07-25-minecraft.html) I want to explore some more functional programming concepts within the bounds of `F#`. *(And maybe make some neat castles along the way)*.

Not sure how this will progress or evolve yet.
